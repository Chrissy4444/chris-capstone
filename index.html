            <h2> HELPING FAMILIES DURING THE MOST DEVASTATING TIMES</h2>
                <p> Caring for a child with cancer is one of the most challenging experiences a family can face. The emotional strain of coping with the uncertainty of life expectancy, the complexities of treatment, and the constant fear for their child's well-being can be overwhelming. In addition, parents often find themselves unable to work while trying to care for their sick child, all while struggling to maintain the day-to-day expenses of running a home. The financial and emotional toll is significant. We invite you to read some personal stories of local families who are navigating this difficult journey, and encourage you to offer support, whether emotional or financial, to help them through this challenging time. Your generosity can make a meaningful difference. </p>
