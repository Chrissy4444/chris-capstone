                    <h2> Helping Families During the Most Devastating Times</h2>
                        <p> Going through cancer with your child is one of the most difficult times for a child and their family. Dealing with the fear of life expectancy and treatment are just the starting points in this diagnosis. Parent's not being able to work and caring for thier sick child while trying to maintain a home is quite costly and stressful. Please read some of the personal stories and help provide support emotionally or financially to our local families going through Childhood Cancer. </p>
